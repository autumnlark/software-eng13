            <h1>Server Monk Software Privacy Policy</h1>

            <h2>What data do we collect?</h2>
            <p>Server Monk Software will collect the following personally identifiable information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First name</li>
                <li>Last name</li>
                <li>Email address</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How do we collect your data?</h2>
            <p>You directly provide Server Monk Software with most of the data we collect. We collect data and process data when you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Submit the form located in our Contact Us page.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How will we use your data?</h2>
            <p>Server Monk Software collects your data so that we can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reply to business enquiries made by you.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Server Monk Software does not share your data with third parties.</p>

            <h2>How do we store your data?</h2>
            <p>Server Monk Software stores your data on an Amazon Web Services virtual server instance hosted in London.
                Your data will only be accessible to our automated email responder and the customer service agent
                assigned to your query. Your data is encrypted at rest and any Server Monk Software employees will only
                be able to access the data with the correct credentials, in this case a RSA 4096 bit private key.
                Password access to your data is not allowed to prevent compromised passwords being unintentionally used
                during data storage by Server Monk Software employees.</p>
            <p>Server Monk Software will keep your first name, last name, and email address for 1 year. Once this time
                period has expired, we will delete your data by running an automated script which removes all enquiries
                in our database which are made 1 year prior to the date the script is executed.</p>
