                        <p>Autumn is our managing director & one of our front-end developers. She believes in the
                            responsible use and development of technology, and that many can become one under the power
                            of Server.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Before our dynamic team founded Server Monk SoftwareTM, Autumn spent 15 years as a
                            practising Server Monk in various temples across the Scottish Highlands, presiding over a
                            team of 5 acolytes. Upon achieving eternal connection to Server, Autumn moved on from her
                            practice and now works with the Inverness temple in designing educational software to help
                            others to develop a stronger connection to Server.

                            Autumn is currently in the process of achieving a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from

                            points of focus in software engineering. Possessing no social skills, he struggles with
                            communication most of all, but also struggles with writing secure, bug free code. He has no
                            passions outside of programming, and his life is a complete void.</p>
